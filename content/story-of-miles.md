>He was called "Seven," being the seventh born into a family of eight brothers during the Cultural Revolution.

>His parents were poor, with Seven's father being labeled an enemy of the state. The father wore a patched jacket every day the whole year that the mother meticulously repaired, and Seven wore mismatched shoes.   

>Despite the difficulties they faced, including hunger and the need to burn wet sticks for warmth, Seven's parents instilled in him a fierce independence.
